# Python-Movie-Regression

This repository contains a correlation and regression project in Python using movie data.  The project involves some brief data cleaning and exploration of correlations, and subsequent plotting of the relationship between variables using a basic scatter plot as well as simple linear regression with budget as the predictor variable.
